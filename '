I am writing this article after trying to follow this guide [Using GraphQL with Python - A Complete Guide](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/complete-api-guide) and failing to do it.
This article serves as a note to my future self and maybe a helpful guide to others who are learning how to setup GraphQL with Python. In this article, I will be using:
- Python 3.10.14 (no particular reason, I just have this version installed)
- Flask (as a server)
- SQLite (I'm not here to learn how to setup an SQL server, so SQLite should be the simplest to use)
- Graphene
