This is the first blog post on this website 🎉.

## So, Why the Move?

> TLDR; to get a better load time performance and easier content creation.

Previously this site was created using [React](https://react.dev/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Using GitHub Pages means you are limited to only hosting static site(static files) only, so no server side component or server side rendering.
While hosting a React+Vite site from GitHub Pages is completely viable (and free), I think there is a wasted opportunity here.
React being a primarily [CSR (Client Side Rendering)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/client-side-rendering)
means everytime someone visits the website, the server (in this case GitHub Pages) only sends the minimal html and a bundle of JavaScript code
to the client. Using CSR means the burden of rendering(loading) the page is placed on the client's device i.e., their phone, computer, or tablet.

> Why do I need burden the client with loading the content?

Since my website consists mostly of static content with little to no interactivity, why do I need to load the content on the client when I 
can just send the completed page anyway? Also I heard having fully rendered pages help with SEO, so there is that.
I am already limited to serving static files only anyway on GitHub Pages, using CSR does not really reduce server side processing for me.
While I get using CSR can still reduce the number of request to the server, it does not do much for me since I am not paying for GitHub Pages.

Thus, the move to [SSG (Static Side Generation)](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/rendering/static-site-generation)
using [Astro](https://astro.build/). Also as a bonus, Astro has a template for blog sites, which makes my job easier building this site.

## Anyway

I will try to put more blog post on this site. 

Thank you ✌️
